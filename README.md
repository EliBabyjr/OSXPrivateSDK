OSXPrivateSDK
=============

SDK target for opensource.apple.com code

1. Quit Xcode
2. Run PrivateSDK.py 
3. Open Xcode and select "Private (10.9)" as your SDK Target


This is based on many of the projects on opensource.apple.com to build in a proper environment. 
Looking for contributions and fixes to add more compatibility to existing projects.
